# seth.run - The RNG Button

### What is it?
The RNG Button is a game about clicking a button to roll a number. The number you roll is purely based on the term "RNG" (Random Number Generator). The lower number you roll, the higher rarity it will be.

### Why did you make this?
I saw that most Roblox experiences nowadays are all based around RNG. Some examples of this are **Sol's RNG (@Axis_53)** & **Player RNG (@haz3mn)**. I got inspired, and so I made my own web-version.

### What are the odds?
It's quite simple. Every time you click the "ROLL" button, the website generates a completely random number from 1 to 10,000. There isn't really any point of adding rarities considering all the numbers are technically the same odds. Read more about rarities below.

### Rarities
Rarities are as followed:

**Cheater! Cheater!** - 10,001 or above.<br>
**Too Common?** - 10,000.<br>
**Common** - 10,000 or below.<br>
**Rare** - 5,000 or below.<br>
**Epic** - 2,500 or below.<br>
**Legendary** - 1,000 or below<br>
**Mythical** - 250 or below.<br>
**RNGesus Incarnate** - 100 or below.<br>
**Mythical One** - 1.
