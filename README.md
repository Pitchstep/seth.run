# seth.run - version 1.201
Hi, I'm Seth and this is my website. I update this from time to time.<br>
If you came to see my /projects updates, scroll down.
<br><br>
**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**<br>
Some of the designs on /designs has been removed. You can still access them by typing in the original link as they are still in the directory.<br>
