# seth.run - version 1.12
Hi, I'm Seth and this is my website. I update this from time to time.

## Update notes

### V1.12 notes
Added new projects.<br>
Added a link to the projects page on the home page.<br>
I've also updated this README.md file so you can read more about seth.run's upcoming features!

### V1.11 notes
Bugfixes and minor changes.<br>
Added GitHub button that leads to this repository.<br>
New stuff in /projects.

### V1.101 patch notes
Bugfixes and minor changes.

### v1.1 notes
I've added advertisements to the website to make a lil bit of cash every now and then. It will not mess with your seth.run experience. ;)<br>
I've also added a privacy policy page to show you what private data I collect. Check it out at https://seth.run/privacy.

### v2.0 information
Version 2 will include lots of features. Such as a chat, larger projects, more designs, new and optimized pages, major bugfixes & more! I don't have a release date for it yet, but I work on this part-time when I'm (mostly) bored.

## More info

### Important about Notepad project
Notes can **only** be loaded on the **device you saved the note on**. In Version 2, you will be able to save the codes and use them on other devices on the internet.

### Advertisements
So I'm selling out... well, not really. I'm adding a few advertisements to seth.run to earn a little. Don't worry though, the ads will not interfere with your experience! If they happen to do so, please let me know by contacting me on Discord!
