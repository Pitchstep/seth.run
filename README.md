# seth.run - version 1
Hi, I'm Seth and this is my website. I update this from time to time.

### v2.0 information
Version 2 will include lots of features. Such as a chat, larger projects, more designs, new and optimized pages, major bugfixes & more! I don't have a release date for it yet, but I work on this part-time when I'm (mostly) bored.

### About
